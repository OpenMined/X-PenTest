## Grid Reconnaisance
This is mainly to discover the different services, ports, technologies the infrastructure uses.
This helps understand the underlying technologies, ports and services so we can search for the versions which are vul>
Tools used :
- `kali OS` with pre-installed tools. But you may need to manually install other custom tools like `ffuf` etc.
- Nmap
- Nikto
- Dirb
#### 1. Nmap : Used for network scanning, port discovery, services using NSE scripts and many more.
- `5 ports` opened, `5000`, `5001`, `5002`, `5003`, `7000`.
-  Ports `5000-5003` and `7000` uses `Ajenti http control panel` which is an open source project maintained by : http>
- http-methods supported  `GET` , `OPTIONS`, `HEAD`.
- Command used : `nmap -p0- -v -A -T4 <IP>` e.g nmap -p0- -v -A -T4 192.168.0.3
- Output screenshots.
- Open ports

#### 2. Nikto : Used for web server scanning.
- For both `Network` and `Wrokers node`,
- `anti-clickjacking X-Frame-Options header` is not present. This  means that this website could be at risk of a clic>
- `X-XSS-Protection header` is not defined which can lead to `XSS` attacks.
- `X-Content-Type-Options header` is not set. There is a possibility to execute `style sheet and steal content` from another site through content type doesn’t match. 
- Network

- Alice similar to the other workers like bob etc.

- Command `nikto -url <url> -C all` , you can also use `nikto -h <url> -C all`. thet are similar.
#### 3. Dirb : use for directory discovery
- For the moment no sensitive directories found.

### Summary

| Threat       | Consequence | Severity |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Multipole open ports    |  Any open port is an attack surface. The daemon that is listing on a port, could be vulnerable to a buffer overflow, or another remotely exploitable vulnerability. It is always important to reduce the attack surface by reducing the number of ports.    | <span style="color:grey">*Low*</span>     |
|anti-clickjacking X-Frame-Options header is not present | This can lead to an attack that can trick a user to click to a web element that is disguised or hidden. Users who click on this element may download malwares or lead them to sites which can steal their bank informations, sensitive files etc. |<span style="color:grey">*Low*</span>|
|X-XSS-Protection header is not defined | This may lead to cross site scripting attacks where malicious user can inject code that will perform actions in the user's browser on behalf of a website. This can lead to performing bank transfers, and many other illegal actions on behalf of the user.| <span style="color:Brown">*Medium*</span>|
|X-Content-Type-Options header is not set |There is a possibility to execute `style sheet and steal content` from another site through content type doesn’t match. |<span style="color:grey">*Low*</span>|
